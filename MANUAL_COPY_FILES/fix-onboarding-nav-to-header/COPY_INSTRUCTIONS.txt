Fix: Move onboarding navigation from floating bottom island into header bar
=========================================================================

PROBLEM:
- Floating bottom island overlapped with step form action buttons
- Some steps showed BOTH the island Continue AND their own button
- Users confused by inconsistent navigation (Continue appears/disappears)

SOLUTION:
- Moved Back, Continue, Skip buttons into the existing header (right side)
- Removed the entire floating bottom island
- Reduced bottom padding from pb-24 to pb-6 (no more island to avoid)
- Form step buttons now have full space at the bottom — no overlap

HEADER LAYOUT (before):
  [CN badge + title]    [progress dots]    [3/11] [X close]

HEADER LAYOUT (after):
  [CN badge + title]    [progress dots]    [Skip?] [< Back] [Continue >] | [3/11] [X]
