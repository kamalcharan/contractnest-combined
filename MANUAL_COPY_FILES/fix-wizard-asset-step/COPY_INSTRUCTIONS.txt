Fix: Skip "Select Client Assets" step for service delivery contracts
=====================================================================

PROBLEM:
When selecting a "Service Delivery" nomenclature in the contract wizard,
the "Select Client Assets" step still appears even though service contracts
don't involve equipment or facilities.

FIX:
1. NomenclatureStep.tsx — passes form_settings to the wizard via onSelect callback
2. ContractWizard/index.tsx — uses form_settings.is_equipment_based / is_entity_based
   flags to determine if asset step should be shown. Falls back to group name check.
