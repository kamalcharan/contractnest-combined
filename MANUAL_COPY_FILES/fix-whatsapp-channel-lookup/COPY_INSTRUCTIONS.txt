FIX: WhatsApp channel lookup - query 'whatsapp' and 'phone' types, not just 'mobile'
============================================================================

Submodules Affected: contractnest-edge

Files Changed:
  contractnest-edge/supabase/functions/contracts/index.ts
    - Changed mobile channel lookup from .eq('channel_type', 'mobile')
      to .in('channel_type', ['mobile', 'whatsapp', 'phone'])
    - Also selects channel_type in the query for visibility

Root Cause:
  Buyer contact's phone number was stored with channel_type = 'whatsapp'
  in t_contact_channels, but the edge function only queried for 'mobile'.
  This caused WhatsApp JTD records to never be created.

Copy Command (PowerShell):
  cd "D:\projects\core projects\ContractNest\contractnest-combined"
  Copy-Item "MANUAL_COPY_FILES\fix-whatsapp-channel-lookup\contractnest-edge\*" -Destination "contractnest-edge\" -Recurse -Force

Deploy:
  cd contractnest-edge
  supabase functions deploy contracts
