COPY INSTRUCTIONS — Cycle 3b: Pre-Payment Flow Redesign
============================================================
Branch: cycle-3b-pre-payment-flow
Date: 2026-02-02

WHAT CHANGED:
  ContractWizard/index.tsx — Redesigned auto-accept flow:
  - Click "Create Contract" now shows payment dialog FIRST
  - User fills payment details OR clicks "Skip"
  - "Record Payment & Create" → creates contract → fetches invoice → records payment → success
  - "Skip" → creates contract → success (no payment)
  - Success screen simplified: shows receipt inline if payment was recorded
  - Removed dependency on RecordPaymentDialog for wizard flow
  - Processing overlay shows step-by-step progress

FILES TO COPY:
  contractnest-ui/src/components/contracts/ContractWizard/index.tsx

SUBMODULES AFFECTED:
  contractnest-ui

COPY COMMANDS (PowerShell):
  cd "D:\projects\core projects\ContractNest\contractnest-combined"
  Copy-Item "MANUAL_COPY_FILES\cycle-3b-pre-payment-flow\contractnest-ui\*" -Destination "contractnest-ui\" -Recurse -Force

TESTING:
  1. Open ContractNest UI → Create Contract
  2. Choose Auto-Accept as acceptance method
  3. Fill in all steps through Review & Send
  4. Click "Create Contract" → payment dialog should appear
  5. Fill payment details → click "Record Payment & Create Contract"
  6. Verify: processing overlay shows steps, then success screen with receipt
  7. Also test: "Skip — Create Without Payment" path
  8. Also test: "Go back to review" link
  9. Also test: non-auto acceptance methods (payment, signoff) still create directly
