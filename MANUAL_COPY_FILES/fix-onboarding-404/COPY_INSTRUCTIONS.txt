Fix: 404 error navigating from "Select Your Industry" to branding step
=======================================================================

ROOT CAUSE:
1. The "served-industries" route (step 7) was MISSING from App.tsx routes
   - The component (ServedIndustriesStep.tsx) existed
   - The step definition existed in onboardingTypes.ts
   - But no <Route> was defined and no import existed in App.tsx
   - After completing business-branding (step 6), navigation tried
     /onboarding/served-industries → 404

2. Two routes used absolute paths inside a nested <Route path="/onboarding">:
   - /onboarding/theme-selection (should be: theme-selection)
   - /onboarding/business-basic (should be: business-basic)

FIX:
- Added import for ServedIndustriesStep
- Added <Route path="served-industries" element={<ServedIndustriesStep />} />
- Changed absolute paths to relative for theme-selection and business-basic
