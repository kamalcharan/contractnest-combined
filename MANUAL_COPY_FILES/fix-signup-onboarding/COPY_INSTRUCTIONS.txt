Fix: Signup → Onboarding redirect + Continue button visibility
================================================================

ISSUE 1: Signup goes to dashboard instead of onboarding
ROOT CAUSE: RegisterPage.tsx has a useEffect that fires when isAuthenticated
changes to true. It overrides AuthContext's navigate('/onboarding') with
navigate('/dashboard').
FIX: Skip the redirect when 'is_new_signup' flag is set in sessionStorage.

ISSUE 2: Login goes to onboarding after re-login
STATUS: This is CORRECT behavior. Login checks onboarding status, finds it
incomplete, redirects to onboarding. No fix needed.

ISSUE 3: Continue button not visible on "Define Your Business Role" step
ROOT CAUSE: After selecting a business type, content expands (info panel +
Continue button appear). The Continue button is pushed below the visible
viewport in the nested scroll area. User doesn't know to scroll.
FIX: Auto-scroll to Continue button when it appears after selection.
