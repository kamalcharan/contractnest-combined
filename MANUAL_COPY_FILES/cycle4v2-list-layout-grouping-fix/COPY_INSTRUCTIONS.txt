 CYCLE 4 v2: List Layout + By Client Fix + 6 Statuses
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

Branch: cycle4v2-list-layout-grouping-fix
Submodules Affected: contractnest-ui, contractnest-edge

ROOT CAUSE (By Client broken):
  The database RPC `get_contracts_list` does NOT have a `p_group_by` parameter.
  The edge function was passing `p_group_by: 'buyer'` which caused the RPC call
  to fail silently. Fix: removed p_group_by from RPC call, implemented grouping
  in JavaScript within the edge function.

Files Changed:

  contractnest-edge/supabase/functions/contracts/index.ts
    → handleList: Removed p_group_by from RPC call (RPC doesn't support it)
    → Added groupContractsByBuyer() helper that groups flat results in JS
    → When group_by=buyer: fetches all contracts (limit 500), groups by buyer,
      calculates group_totals (count, value, collected, avg_health, overdue)
    → Returns { groups: [...], total_count, pagination } matching UI expectations

  contractnest-ui/src/components/contracts/list/ContractPortfolioRow.tsx
    → Changed from grid card to horizontal list row
    → Layout: [Avatar] [Title+CN#] [Status badge] [Client] [Type] [Value] [Overdue] [Eye]
    → Red left border only for risk (no bg change)
    → Colored circle avatar with consistent hash-based colors

  contractnest-ui/src/pages/contracts/hub/index.tsx
    → Single-column list layout (not 3-column grid)
    → Only 6 statuses: Draft, In Review, Pending, Active, Completed, Expired
    → Active is the DEFAULT selected status
    → Pipeline bar with big count numbers + colored bar segments (not pill buttons)
    → Removed PortfolioSummaryStrip (replaced by pipeline bar)
    → Grouped view: single-column list rows under each group header

  contractnest-ui/src/components/contracts/list/ClientGroupHeader.tsx
    → Same as before (improved expand/collapse from earlier)
