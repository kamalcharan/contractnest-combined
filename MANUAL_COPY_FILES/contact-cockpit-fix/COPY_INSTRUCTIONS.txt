# CONTACT COCKPIT FIX - COPY INSTRUCTIONS
# ========================================
# Date: 2026-02-05
# Purpose: Fix undefined 'colors' variable in cockpit components
#
# ISSUE: Both ContactCockpitStatsBar.tsx and ContactCockpitPanel.tsx
#        were using 'colors.utility.*' but 'colors' was never defined.
#        Only 'isDarkMode' was destructured from useTheme().
#        This caused a runtime crash preventing components from rendering.
#
# FIX: Replaced inline styles using undefined 'colors' with Tailwind
#      classes using 'isDarkMode' conditionals.
